instead of using addresses, use usernames
"void" user as "0x0...0"; Compuledger's developers can decide to hard fork to take something out the void; this is also the address that mint tokens/NFTs
LED as network's token for gas
use IPFS hash for txs
deduplicate data of a tx in the very tx
weekly deduplication, which requires re-orging but secured by the main log. even the main log relies on deduplication of its own data
support to commits, where a tx only adds a diffing to another tx (these should be taken in account with care, by the weekly deduplication)
secure eth proofs on bitcoin, and bitcoin proofs on eth (call these crossproofs as ViceVersa)
dl bitcoin blockchain and others, but deduplicate while maintaining the merkletree's hashes; snapshot and offer gas refunds in GLUE's native tokens covering the costs of dupliced data!
