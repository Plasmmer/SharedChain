Are you ready for the next IPFS release? CommonChain are.

Every commonchain watches for a specific release file (for example, every go-ipfs_*_linux-amd64.tar.gz).
-
At every new release, CommonChain receives the latest tag, downloads the file (such as go-ipfs_*_linux-amd64.tar.gz), verifies its CID, and stores all the infos (URL, CID, previous block) in a newly generated block.
